# How to install B2B Components from CDN

For vanilla JS or Vue projects, you can also consume our components from our CDN by adding the imports in your root
html.

This import will lazy load any components you use, meaning, Vue will only bundle the components in use, and
not the whole library.

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://b2b-design-system.otto.market/dist/b2b-core-components/b2b-core-components.css" />
<script
  type="module"
  src="https://b2b-design-system.otto.market/dist/b2b-core-components/b2b-core-components.esm.js"></script>
```
