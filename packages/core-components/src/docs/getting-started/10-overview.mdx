# B2B DESIGN SYSTEM

The goal of the [B2B Design System](https://github.com/otto-de/b2b-design-system) is to provide frontend components that encapsulate styles and behaviour for teams
to use ideally out of the box.

<br />

## Web Components

We value highly independent teams, which is why we support multiple JavaScript frameworks with our
solution. [Web
Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/) are a set of native features that provide a model for encapsulation of
individual HTML elements that is [already highly compatible](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/) with Javascript Frameworks.

<br />

## What is a pattern?

Patterns are recurring building blocks and components in the frontend that are provided centrally with the goal of
ensuring visual and functional consistency. Patterns can be provided at different levels: local patterns
are developed by an OPC module team â€“ global patterns are developed by the BlaBlaFish team and made available to all
OPC module teams.

<br />

## Framework Compatibility

Currently, we support Vue 2, 3 and React.

If you would like to start right away, choose your framework and follow the guides.

## Packages and version

Since publishing our package to npm in May 2023 and thus being open source, we are in v1.0.x.
You can find an overview of current and previous versions [here](https://github.com/otto-de/b2b-design-system/releases).
