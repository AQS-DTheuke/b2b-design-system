## How to use b2b-react-components

The distribution of this package exposes already first class react components that include typing to help the
development experience if you use typescript. Once the package has been installed, just import the b2b-components as you
would normally import any other component:

```js
import { B2bButton } from '@otto-de/b2b-react-components';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <B2bButton type="secondary">Secondary</B2bButton>
    </>
  );
};
```
