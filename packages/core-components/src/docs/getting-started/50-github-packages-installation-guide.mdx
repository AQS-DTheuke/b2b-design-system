# Package Installation

Visit [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40otto-de) and install our core components directly by running for example:

```
npm i @otto-de/b2b-core-components
```

To use the components, you need to load a CSS file in the root of your application, which includes the fonts and the design tokens. In this case, there is no need to install the tokens package again.

```js
import '@otto-de/b2b-core-components/dist/b2b-core-components/b2b-core-components.css';
```

For a more detailed guide of installation and usage please follow one of our framework guidelines:
