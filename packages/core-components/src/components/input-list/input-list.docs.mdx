# Input List Component

_click the component to focus and display the list_

<Canvas columns={3} withSource="open" withToolbar={false}>
  <Story id="components-form-input-list--story-020-input-list-focused" />
</Canvas>

This component will receive a list of options to be presented to the user. It is not a dropdown, and it should be
used as part of a search or filter component, or in any other use case where a list of results makes sense.

<br />

## Properties

### label, placeholder

Will be passed down as an input label and placeholder.

<Source
  language="tsx"
  format={false}
  code={dedent`
    <b2b-input-list placeholder="search here"></b2b-input-list>
  `}
/>

### optionsList

Use to present a list of suggestions to the user. It is currently limited to cursor navigation, but later we will implement keyboard navigation as well.

<Source
  language="tsx"
  format={false}
  code={dedent`
    <b2b-input-list optionsList={myOptionsList}></b2b-input-list>
  `}
/>

## Events

### OnB2b-option-selected

This event will emit when the user clicks on an option from the list, if optionsList was provided.

<Source
  language="tsx"
  format={false}
  code={dedent`
  const onOptionSelected = event => {
    const selectedOption = event.detail.selectedOption;
  };
  return (
    <B2bSearch
      onB2b-option-selected={onOptionSelected}
    />
  )
  `}
/>

## Custom Lists

You can also provide your HTML for the list instead of an array of options. This allows you to display nested or individually styled lists.
To do so, you can simply nest your custom list HTML in the input list component. **_Please do not supply an `optionsList` in this case. Additionally, keyboard navigation and option selection must be implemented
by you as a consumer, because the component has no knowledge about the slotted list content it displays._**

<Source
  language="html"
  format={false}
  code={dedent`
    <b2b-input-list>
      <ul>
        <li>Option 1</li>
        <li>Option 2</li>
        <li>
          Option 3
          <ul>
            <li>Option 3.1</li>
            <li>Option 3.2</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
    </b2b-input-list>
  `}
/>
