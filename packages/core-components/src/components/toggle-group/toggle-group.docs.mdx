# Toggle Button Group

</Canvas>

The Toggle Group can contain multiple individual `b2b-toggle-buttons`. They behave
like a radio button group. When an individual button is selected, the group will emit
the current value. The Toggle Group is most commonly used to switch between number of
entries per page in a table. The toggle button group is fully accessible in the same
way that regular radio groups are.

**Individual toggle buttons must have a name, a label and a value. The name binds them to the toggle
group, the label is the text displayed on the toggle button and the value is what is emitted
when the button is selected.**

## Properties

### Name

The name of the toggle group. This is required because it is used to group individual
toggle buttons together programmatically and aids accessiblity. In order to group
toggle buttons together, use the same name on all of them.

### Disabled

This disables all toggle buttons in a group. It is also possible to disable single
toggle buttons by setting their `disabled` prop individually:

```html
<b2b-toggle-button disabled="true"></b2b-toggle-button>
```

## Events

### b2b-group-change

This event is emitted whenever the current value of the toggle group changes.

```typescript
export interface ToggleButtonEventDetail {
  value: any;
}
```
